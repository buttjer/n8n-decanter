# n8n-decanter — Plan

Standalone CLI that keeps the **Code-node source** of n8n workflows in git:
one folder per workflow, every Code node's source as its own file (`.js` with
JSDoc, or `.ts` compiled one-way), synced with the instance over **n8n's
built-in MCP server** — draft-first, code-only. Workflow *structure* is n8n's
job (the editor, or n8n's own MCP tools); decanter mirrors it into a
read-only `workflow.json` snapshot for review diffs and offline tooling.

This identity is the Plan 32 pivot (2026-07-22, maintainer GO): decanter
stopped being a canonical whole-workflow sync tool over the public REST API
and became **the Code-node craftsmanship layer** — the distinctive part
(shared TS, typecheck, local run/simulate, per-node git history) — while
structure and lifecycle are delegated to n8n's own agent surface (MCP +
official skills). Rewritten from the API-era plan; superseded mechanics are
kept below as compact history where they explain present shapes.

## Decisions made

- **Structure-verb retirement (2026-07-22, post-Plan-33): decanter has no
  structure/lifecycle verbs — n8n's MCP is the authoring surface, `pull` is
  the reconciler.** `rename`, `create`, `archive`, `node create`, and
  `node rename` were removed (maintainer decision; `node run` stays — offline
  execution has no MCP equivalent). The reasoning: every one of those verbs
  wrapped an MCP tool the agent can call directly through the guard, and the
  local bookkeeping they bundled is exactly what `pull` already does for acts
  made in the UI or by other clients. What replaced them: (a) the **guarded
  authoring loop** — an agent adds a Code node over MCP `addNode` **without**
  `jsCode` (the guard blocks code), `pull` lands it as an empty file, the
  first `push` seeds the source; `getWorkflowDetails` normalizes a
  jsCode-less JS Code node to `""` at the read choke point so every verb sees
  it; (b) the scaffolded **`.mcp.json`/`opencode.json` wire the guard by
  default** (see "MCP guard" below). Losses accepted: no client-side `$('…')`
  rewrite in local `.ts` sources on rename (n8n never sees `.ts`; documented
  as a by-hand step), and `create`'s enforced validate-before-create is now
  the skills'/agent's discipline.
- **Plan 32 (2026-07-22): the workflow code path rides n8n's MCP server; the
  public API stays only where MCP has no equivalent.** The invariant that
  made the pivot safe: *Code-node source in git* lives in the file layer and
  survived the backend swap untouched. What flexed: `workflow.json` demoted
  to a read-only snapshot; whole-workflow structural hashing, the
  PUT-canonical drift guard, watch's structural-conflict machinery
  (`workflow.remote.json`), and the `.remote.js` conflict artifacts all
  deleted; per-node content hashing kept as the only drift guard. Spike- and
  smoke-verified against n8n 2.30.7 (see "MCP backend" below).
- **Draft-first is the product, not a caveat.** MCP `update_workflow` writes
  land on the workflow's draft and `publish_workflow` is a separate act —
  the API-era "auto-publish on push to an active workflow" behavior (a
  server-side `publishIfActive: true` hardcode) is gone along with the API
  path. `push --publish` composes the two for the common case.
- **Structure acts are forwarded, never synced.** `rename`, `node create`,
  and `node rename` (offline in the API era, "push to propagate") now issue
  the matching MCP op (`setWorkflowMetadata`, `addNode`, `renameNode`) and
  pull the result. The framing that keeps the boundary honest: sync verbs
  touch only Code-node source; ref verbs *relay deliberate user acts* to
  n8n — decanter still never owns structure.
- **Per-verb API decisions (Plan 32 Task 4, revised by Plan 33):**
  `publish`/`unpublish`/`create` re-based onto MCP
  (`create_workflow_from_code` with the minimal `workflow('<slug>',
  '<name>')` SDK expression, gated by `validate_workflow` since Plan 33;
  MCP-created workflows are born `availableInMCP`, so the follow-up pull
  works). `executions` and `data-tables` stay on the API (no MCP row reads).
- **Plan 33 (2026-07-22, maintainer decision): no hard delete and no clone in
  decanter.** The Plan 32 execution had kept `delete` (REST hard delete) and
  `duplicate` (lossless REST `POST /workflows`); both verbs are **gone**.
  `archive` (MCP `archive_workflow`) replaces `delete` with the same consent
  gate — reversible in the n8n UI, which also owns permanent deletion.
  `duplicate` was **dropped rather than re-based**: MCP has no lossless
  full-JSON create (only SDK-code creation), and the candidate SDK-code
  bridge — n8n's own `@n8n/workflow-sdk` npm generator — would have added a
  ~20 MB Sustainable-Use-licensed dependency tree to an MIT CLI for one verb;
  a hand-rolled emitter risked silent wiring divergence. The n8n UI
  duplicates natively; decanter pulls the copy. Consequence: the API-only
  surface was `executions` + `data-tables` fetches — later joined by `backup`
  (Plan 51 Part B; below).
- **Plan 51 (2026-07-23): `backup` re-adds a REST full-JSON path, framed as
  disaster recovery — not sync.** Two spikes settled the design (both live
  against n8n 2.30.7 + source). **Spike 1 (why not MCP/`.ts` deploy):**
  `create_workflow_from_code` is deployable but *lossy + create-only* —
  `jsCode` byte-exact, but node ids are **regenerated** (SDK grammar has no id
  slot), it always mints a **new** workflow, and settings/tags/pinData drop;
  the only faithful emitter (`generateWorkflowCode`) lives solely in the
  Sustainable-Use-licensed ~124 MB `@n8n/workflow-sdk`, not over MCP — so
  "fully deployable over MCP" is unreachable losslessly. **Spike 2 (why REST,
  not the MCP snapshot):** reading the *same* credentialed workflow both ways,
  MCP's sanitized `get_workflow_details` **strips** node credential refs +
  `pinData` + `staticData` + `description` (keeping jsCode/connections/
  settings/tags identical), while REST `GET /workflows/:id` is full-fidelity,
  reads the **draft tip**, shows no write/read race, and **`GET → POST`
  round-trips losslessly** (node ids, credential refs, pinData, webhookId all
  preserved). Hence `backup` sources from REST and redeploys via REST
  (`lib/backup.mts`, `lib/api.mts` `getWorkflow`/`createWorkflow`). Since both
  MCP and REST expose only the current tip and can't export a *past* version's
  content, **git is the only place a redeployable version history can live** —
  a committed, redeployable backup makes git a real second versioning + DR
  layer outside n8n. `restore` creates a **new** workflow (new workflow id,
  node ids preserved), landing unpublished — it never reconciles an existing
  one; structure ownership stays with n8n. Consequence: the API-only surface
  is `executions` + `data-tables` + `backup`.
- **esbuild** compiles `.ts` node files (`bundle: false`, `format: "cjs"`,
  `target: node18`). Comments are stripped and lines shift — accepted.
  Consequence: instance-side edits on TS nodes can't be auto-merged back into
  the `.ts`; they are *detected* and warned about (`status --diff` to
  inspect; the `.remote.js` artifact files died with Plan 32).
- **`.js` nodes are the lossless default**: pushed/pulled verbatim, byte-identical
  round-trip. Type-check via JSDoc + `checkJs`. Git merges them like any file.
- **`.ts` nodes are one-way**: local `.ts` is source of truth. Push compiles and
  appends a marker (see below). Pull never touches the `.ts`.
- **Marker** identifies TS-managed nodes, appended post-compile as the last line:

  ```
  // @ts-n8n sha256:<hex hash of the compiled JS excluding this line>
  ```

  Presence of the marker ⇒ node is TS-managed (self-describing, no config entry).
  Pull strips the marker line before hashing/comparing. Push also sends a
  body-equal node when the remote lacks the marker (so a freshly converted
  `.ts` node gets marked on its first push instead of warning forever).
- **Git workflow (decided 2026-07-19; releases decoupled 2026-07-21):
  protected main, releases via a dedicated release PR.** No direct commits to
  main; short-lived branches, squash-merged via PR (linear main, one commit per
  PR). **Feature PRs are decoupled from releases** — a user-facing PR only
  appends its entry under `[Unreleased]`; it does *not* bump `package.json`,
  tag, or release. Releasing is a separate, deliberate `chore/release-x.y.z`
  PR. `npm publish` is the maintainer's step. Full scheme in AGENTS.md.
- **n8n 2.x only (user decision 2026-07-19), with an MCP floor since Plan 32.**
  The tool targets the 2.x line exclusively; the MCP sync path additionally
  needs the built-in MCP server (~2.20+; all Plan 32 behavior verified on
  2.30.7), MCP access enabled instance-wide, and the per-workflow
  `availableInMCP` opt-in. Continuously verified against real 2.x instances
  by the plans/15 smoke suite (version matrix via `SMOKE_N8N_TAG`, plans/22).

```

- Workflow **id** lives in `workflow.json` (and `.decanter.json`) → the folder
  name is a free local pick. Pull matches folders by id. A **new** folder is the
  **kebab-case slug** of the workflow name (`Order Sync` → `order-sync/`; a slug
  collision with a different workflow falls back to `<slug>-<id8>` + a warn); an
  **existing** folder is left as-is — folders are sticky and never follow a
  remote rename (Plan 27). The always-current display name is cached in
  `.decanter.json.name`.
- Node files live in the folder's `code/` subdir, named after the node name in
  **kebab-case** (`Parse Order` → `code/parse-order.js`). Node **id** is the
  real key — **ids survive renames** (spike-verified, including MCP
  `renameNode`), which is the whole identity design (Plan 32 Task 3):
  `.decanter.json` maps node-id → file path, MCP ops address nodes *by name*,
  and push looks each id's current name up from a fresh read. A structure-side
  rename (UI, or any agent via MCP) therefore just moves
  the local file on the next pull; per-pull collision handling is
  deterministic, so a freed kebab base is re-claimed by the next pull. The
  same rename machinery migrates pre-`code/` flat layouts.
- **`workflow.json` is a read-only snapshot** (Plan 32 Task 6, promoted from
  nice-to-have to core since so much offline tooling reads it): pull rewrites
  it from the workflow *tip*; nothing pushes it; `status` prints an
  informational stale hint when the remote structure moved. Pretty-printed
  with stable key order → clean review diffs of structure changes made in
  n8n. The one meaningful local edit is re-pointing a `//@file:` placeholder
  (the human-visible file map; push honors it — that's how `.js` ↔ `.ts`
  conversions work). Derived/permission fields are stripped on pull:
  `activeVersion`, `activeVersionId`, `shared`, `scopes`, `canExecute`. The
  draft `versionId` is kept (the executions stale-fixture warning reads it).
  It stays *decanter-read-only*, but the **guard now keeps it live** (Plan 51
  Part A, `lib/mirror.mts`): when an agent's structure edit is forwarded
  through the guard (`mcp connect`/`serve` — a non-blocked `update_workflow`),
  decanter schedules a **debounced background `pull`** of that workflow, so
  the snapshot (+ code files + state, incl. rename file-moves) refreshes with
  no manual `pull`. Safety rails: fire-and-forget (the agent's tool call is
  never blocked); git-required + safety-commit-before-pull (skip with a
  warn-once when there's no git); per-workflow debounce + overlap guard (never
  two pulls, or a pull mid-pull, for one workflow); tracked-only (an untracked
  id — e.g. a `create_workflow_from_code` — is skipped with a hint). On by
  default; `liveMirror: false` disables it (CI/deterministic setups).

### `.decanter.json` (per workflow)

```json
{
  "workflowId": "0cXNQKKzmO0pXiCq",
  "name": "Order Sync",
  "nodes": {
    "<node-id>": {
      "file": "code/amazon-feed.ts",
      "lastPushedHash": "sha256:…",
      "name": "Amazon Feed"
    }
  }
}
```

`name` (workflow-level) is the cached display name, refreshed on every pull
(Plan 27). Per-node `name` (Plan 32) is a cache for messages about nodes that
vanished remotely — push always resolves id → current name from a fresh read,
never from this cache. `lastPushedHash` = hash of the *remote* marker-less
code body at last sync (push **or** pull) — the per-node drift base and the
only sync hash left. The API-era `lastPulledWorkflowHash` (structure hash) is
gone; pull scrubs it from old state files.

## MCP backend (`lib/mcp.mts`, Plan 32)

The sync backend is n8n's built-in MCP server — `POST /mcp-server/http`,
JSON-RPC over streamable HTTP, spoken by a minimal hand-rolled client (no SDK
dependency). Everything below is verified against n8n 2.30.7 (spike + smoke,
2026-07-22; raw shapes in the plan32-mcp-api-facts memory and AGENTS.md
"Driving a real n8n in Docker").

- **Protocol:** `initialize` handshake (protocol `2025-03-26`) once per
  process, echo the `mcp-session-id` response header on later calls, send
  `accept: application/json, text/event-stream` and parse both plain-JSON and
  SSE (`data:` lines) responses. Tool results are
  `{content:[{type:"text",text}], structuredContent?, isError?}`; the client
  prefers `structuredContent`, falls back to parsing `text`, and normalizes
  `isError` to a thrown `McpToolError` carrying the server's message verbatim
  (n8n's own guidance texts are good — surface them unfiltered).
  `publish_workflow` reports failure **in-band** (`success:false` + `error`),
  normalized to a throw too.
- **Tools used:** `search_workflows` (lists ALL workflows instance-wide,
  `availableInMCP` flag per row; limit ≤ 200, no cursor),
  `get_workflow_details` (full nodes with ids + byte-exact `jsCode`,
  `versionId`/`activeVersionId`; the workflow **tip** — draft if one exists,
  else published content), `update_workflow` (atomic op batch, name-addressed;
  `updateNodeParameters` **merges** — a `{jsCode}`-only write preserves
  sibling params; returns a summary, never the workflow), `publish_workflow`
  / `unpublish_workflow`, `create_workflow_from_code`.
- **The availability gate:** `search_workflows` sees everything, but
  details/update/publish refuse workflows without `availableInMCP`
  ("Workflow is not available in MCP. Enable MCP access from the workflow
  card…"). Surfaced as a third picker state (red `⊘`, sorted last, Enter →
  guidance), `(not available in MCP)` markers + hint in `list --remote`
  (`--json`: `mcpAvailable`), and an appended hint on pull/push errors
  (`isUnavailableInMcp` classifier). Toggling is a user act in n8n — the
  internal `/rest/mcp/workflows/toggle-access` route is version-fragile and
  only used by the smoke suite's bootstrap, never by the shipped CLI.
- **Auth:** two methods, resolved in order — `N8N_MCP_TOKEN` (rotatable
  bearer from n8n Settings → MCP; the public API key is NOT a valid MCP
  bearer) wins, else the OAuth credentials in `.decanter-auth.json` (host,
  client id, refresh token, cached access token + expiry; 0600). **Refresh
  tokens rotate and the old one is invalid the moment a refresh succeeds** —
  the client persists the rotated pair before doing anything else, caches
  access tokens (3600 s, 60 s margin) so refreshes stay rare, refreshes once
  on a 401, and maps a terminal `invalid_grant` to "re-run init". An auth
  file minted for a different host is ignored with a warning. OAuth endpoint
  discovery (`/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`) re-bases every
  advertised endpoint onto the configured host — instances behind
  proxies/containers advertise their own idea of their URL.
- **Rate limiting:** n8n 429s the MCP endpoint under bursts (hit live by the
  smoke suite's rapid CLI runs). The client backs off and retries (≤ 5,
  Retry-After-aware, else 1/2/4/8 s) — safe for every tool since a 429'd
  request was not applied.
- **Errors:** 404 → "enable MCP access in n8n (Settings → MCP; needs ~2.20+)";
  401 bearer → "mint a fresh token (the public API key is not a valid MCP
  token)"; timeouts honor `requestTimeoutMs` with the same guidance as the
  API era.

## Config

`decanter.config.json`:

```json
{
  "root": "./workflows",
  "workflows": ["0cXNQKKzmO0pXiCq", "zhwm1hNadTUtpDBP"]
}
```

Ids only — names, folders, node lists are all derived on pull. Optional keys:
`commitOnPush`/`commitOnPull` (default `true`), `requestTimeoutMs` (default
`30000` — per-request timeout on MCP and API calls; init's probes are fixed
at 10 s), `dataTables` (default `true`, plans/25), `liveMirror` (default
`true`, plans/51 Part A — the guard's background `workflow.json` refresh;
`false` disables it), `backupLimit` (default `20`, plans/51 Part B — the
retained `backups/` working-set cap; `0` keeps all), `bundleDependencies`
(default `[]`, plans/14). `browserReload`/`proxyPort` (plans/5) were removed
in Plan 52 — a stale value in an existing config is ignored, not an error.

Credentials (Plan 32): `N8N_HOST` is required for online verbs; MCP
credentials (env token or auth file) power the sync/structure/lifecycle
verbs; `N8N_API_KEY` is **optional** and guarded per-verb (`requireApiKey`
names the verb in its error) — only `executions`, `data-tables`, and `backup`
need it (Plan 33 + 51). `loadConfig`'s old `requireCredentials` became
`requireHost`.

## Workflow refs & CLI output (plans/11)

The grammar is **verb-first** (Plan 27): `n8n-decanter <verb> [workflow…]`.
`node run` lives under the **`node` namespace**, scenarios under `scenario`
(`create`/`check`), the agent guard under `mcp` (`connect`/`serve`). Flags may
sit anywhere; `--publish` (Plan 32) joins `--force`/`--no-typecheck` on push.

**`--version`/`-v` is reserved CLI-wide** and answered first — before the
value-flag parser, config load, or verb dispatch — printing the installed
package version. No verb may claim that spelling: `backup restore` originally
did (Plan 51), which made the conventional `n8n-decanter --version` exit 1 with
"`--version` needs a value"; the selector is now `--version-id`. Verb-scoped
flags that mean "a version" spell it out (`--version-id`, `--n8n-version`).

Every `[workflow…]` argument is a **ref**: an id, a workflow/folder name, or
a unique name prefix. Resolution is tiered — exact id → exact name
(case-insensitive) → unique prefix — and never prompts. An id-shaped ref that
matches nothing passes through unresolved; `pull` additionally resolves
unknown names against MCP `search_workflows` (which sees every workflow,
opted-in or not). A ref verb given no workflow opens the picker on a TTY to
pick one (the verb menu is skipped). **For `pull` the no-ref picker merges the
remote `search_workflows` list** (like the bare picker), so a fresh setup with
nothing pulled still gets a menu — pick a not-yet-local workflow and it pulls;
the other ref verbs act on local files, so they pick among already-pulled
workflows only.

The **interactive picker** (Plan 19/23) shows three states since Plan 32:
pulled (green `●`), unpulled-but-available (yellow `○`), and
**MCP-unavailable (red `⊘`, sorted last)** — Enter on a `⊘` row resolves to
an `enable-mcp` sentinel the CLI turns into guidance (where the n8n-side
switch lives) instead of a failing pull; the legend gains `⊘ not in MCP` only
when such rows exist, and the Enter hint switches to "enter how to enable".
The remote list rides `search_workflows`. Everything else about the picker
(type-to-filter, verb menu, resume loop, skeleton rows, TTY-gating, pure
state machine exported for tests) is unchanged from Plans 19/23/27.

Output follows **one rule: styling and transient output exist only when the
target stream is a TTY**; piped output is plain line-oriented text and no
information is carried by color alone (the `⊘` glyph carries the third state
by shape). Exit codes: `status` exits **1 on code conflict/remote code
drift** — narrowed by Plan 32: remote *structure* changes are an
informational snapshot-stale hint, not drift (structure is n8n's business,
and MCP/skills edits would otherwise keep CI permanently red). `DEBUG=1`
prints stack traces.

## Pull flow (`n8n-decanter pull [id…]`)

For each configured workflow:

1. MCP `get_workflow_details` — the tip (draft if one exists, else the
   published content; a *superseded* published version is unreadable over
   MCP, so pull syncs the tip by design). Unavailable → the server's
   guidance text + the CLI's enable hint.
2. Locate the local folder by id (scan `.decanter.json`s under root). An
   existing folder is kept as-is (sticky, Plan 27); a new one gets the
   kebab slug (`<slug>-<id8>` + warn on collision). Cache the display name.
3. Refresh the id→file map from the snapshot's `//@file:` placeholders — the
   **same** reconcile push runs (§ Push flow 1). This makes a re-pointed
   placeholder (a `.js`→`.ts` conversion) survive a pull that fires before the
   first TS push — notably the live-mirror background refresh after a structure
   edit, which otherwise treated the stale `.js` map entry as authoritative and
   rewrote the placeholder back to `.js` (Plan 35 field-test finding).
4. For each JS Code node (`n8n-nodes-base.code`), matched by node id:
   - **Marker present** → TS-managed: compare `hash(remote body)` vs
     `hash(compile(local .ts))` — in sync → nothing; local == lastPushedHash
     → **instance-side edit**: warn (inspect via `status --diff`), `.ts`
     untouched; remote == lastPushedHash → local modified, info; both moved →
     **CONFLICT** warning. No `.remote.js` files are written (Plan 32).
   - **No marker, local `.ts` exists** → never clobber TS source: keep the
     `.ts`, warn ("not pushed from TS yet?"), re-baseline.
   - **No marker** → plain JS: overwrite `code/<node>.js` with the remote
     body (git is the safety net; a warning flags when that clobbers
     unpushed local edits).
   - Node renamed → rename the file (id-keyed map), update state.
5. Write the `workflow.json` snapshot (placeholders substituted; derived
   fields stripped — see layout).
6. Update `.decanter.json`: per-node `lastPushedHash` (= remote body hash),
   per-node `name`, workflow `name`; scrub the legacy structure hash.
7. Optional auto-commit (`commitOnPull`).

## Push flow (`n8n-decanter push [id…] [--force] [--publish]`)

Before anything else, two local gates run: the **compliance guard** per
workflow and — unless `--no-typecheck` — the **typecheck** once per push.
Guard errors abort and are *not* bypassable with `--force`.

1. Refresh the id→file map from the snapshot's `//@file:` placeholders (the
   human-visible file map — this is what makes a local `.js` → `.ts`
   re-point take effect). Pull runs the **same** reconcile (§ Pull flow 3), so
   a conversion survives an intervening pull.
2. MCP `get_workflow_details` (fresh read). For each tracked node id: resolve
   its **current remote name** (the name↔id reconciliation — renames made
   anywhere are absorbed here), build the local payload (`.js` verbatim;
   `.ts` esbuild + marker), and compare hashes:
   - remote body moved off `lastPushedHash` *and* differs from the local
     payload → **per-node drift**: abort with "pull first" (`--force`
     overrides). A remote edit that equals the local payload re-baselines
     silently.
   - body equal (and marker present where expected) → skip; else queue a
     `{type:"updateNodeParameters", nodeName, parameters:{jsCode}}` op.
   - node id missing remotely → warn + skip (pull cleans state); a remote
     Code node not tracked locally → info ("pull to extract it") — never an
     abort (structure is n8n's business).
3. One atomic `update_workflow` batch (merge semantics keep sibling params
   like `mode`/`language` intact). The write lands on the **draft**;
   `versionId` moves, `activeVersionId` doesn't.
4. **Confirming read** — `update_workflow` returns only a summary, so hashes
   are recorded from a post-write `get_workflow_details` (the moral successor
   of the API-era "record from the PUT response" rule), with a byte-exact
   round-trip warning if the server normalized anything.
5. `--publish` → `publish_workflow` afterwards. Result lines state the draft
   reality: `— draft updated; the live version is unchanged (run "publish"
   to go live)` / `— unpublished draft` / `— published: code is live now`.
6. Optional auto-commit (`commitOnPush`).

## Compliance guard (`n8n-decanter check [id…]`)

Unchanged by Plan 32 in substance — the guard validates the *file layer*,
which is exactly the layer decanter still owns. Runs at the start of every
push and standalone as `check` (offline, credential-free).

Errors (block push / exit 1): inline `jsCode` in the snapshot instead of a
placeholder; placeholders referencing missing files, `.remote.js` leftovers,
non-`.js`/`.ts` files, or files outside `code/`; a `.js` file ending with an
`@ts-n8n` marker; imports in `.js` nodes / bundling violations in `.ts`
nodes (plans/14); missing/corrupt `workflow.json` or `.decanter.json`;
structural integrity of the snapshot (dangling connections, duplicate node
names/ids, orphan code files, dangling literal `$('…')` references in code
and expression parameters).

Warnings (don't block): unresolved `.remote.js` / `workflow.remote.json`
leftovers — pre-Plan-32 artifacts; port and delete them.

Typecheck gate: unchanged (see Type checking; scoping, template verify hook).

## Structure & lifecycle acts (n8n's MCP + pull-reconcile)

The structure/lifecycle **verbs are retired** (see "Decisions made") — the
acts live in n8n's MCP tools, reached by agents through the guard, and
decanter's contract is the **reconcile**:

- **Workflow rename** (`setWorkflowMetadata`, or the UI) → next `pull`
  re-caches the display name; the folder never moves (Plan 27).
- **Node rename** (`renameNode`; n8n rewrites connections and `$('…')`
  expression refs server-side, node id stable) → next `pull` renames the
  local file (kebab collisions get `-<id8>`), re-points the placeholder,
  updates the id-keyed map. `$('…')` refs inside local `.ts` sources are a
  documented by-hand step (n8n holds compiled output, never `.ts`).
- **Code node added** (`addNode` **without** `jsCode` — the guard blocks
  code) → the node is born empty; `getWorkflowDetails` normalizes the
  missing `jsCode` to `""`, so `pull` lands it as an empty `code/` file
  (server-minted id and all) and the first `push` seeds the source. Lands
  disconnected — wiring is structure and stays in n8n.
- **Workflow created** (`create_workflow_from_code`; the skills' discipline
  is `validate_workflow` first) → `pull <fresh id>` (MCP-born workflows are
  auto-available; born unpublished; the server assigns the id).
- **Archive** (`archive_workflow`, or the UI) → server-side it unpublishes a
  live workflow first; afterwards the archived-first gate refuses all MCP
  access ("archived and cannot be accessed"), which decanter's verbs surface
  verbatim. The local folder stays as the git record.

## Lifecycle verbs (`lib/lifecycle.mts`)

- **`publish` / `unpublish`** → MCP `publish_workflow` / `unpublish_workflow`
  (in-band `success:false` normalized to errors). Since pushes are
  draft-only, `publish` is THE go-live step: already-published is only a
  no-op when `activeVersionId === versionId`; a diverged draft re-publishes.

## Execution datasets (`executions`, plans/3 C) and data tables (plans/25)

Both **unchanged by Plan 32 and deliberately still on the public API** — the
surfaces MCP cannot serve (spike-verified: data-table tools are add-only with
no row reads; full execution run-data reads were not available). Their design
records stand as before:

- `executions [workflow…] [--status=…] [--limit=N]` fetches recent executions
  with full run data into self-gitignored `workflows/<folder>/executions/`;
  a numeric arg fetches one by id; `clean` is offline. Executions run the
  *published* version — the stale-fixture warning compares each
  `workflowVersionId` against the snapshot's draft `versionId` (kept in
  `workflow.json` for exactly this). Never synced back; never in git.
- `data-tables [table…] [--filter/--search/--sort/--limit/--all]` fetches
  schema + rows into the top-level self-gitignored `data-tables/` dir;
  read-only by design; config-gated by `dataTables`; `clean` offline. Scopes
  and endpoint facts in the plan25-datatables-api-facts memory.

## Watch mode (`n8n-decanter watch <workflow>`)

Radically simplified by Plan 32 — the fast inner loop for a workflow's
**code**:

- **Watch start = snapshot commit + pull**, unchanged rationale (the commit
  must land before pull overwrites `.js` files and the snapshot; no git → the
  startup pull is skipped). A dim note states the draft-only reality: run
  `publish` to take changes live.
- **Code saves** map the changed file back to its node (state re-read per
  event, so mid-session renames resolve) and push **only that node** — a
  single-op MCP `update_workflow`, per-node drift guard as in push. 200 ms
  debounce, overlap guard, dirty-set queueing — all as before.
- **`workflow.json` saves push nothing.** The snapshot is read-only; the
  first save in a session warns once ("structure changes belong in n8n"),
  then stays quiet. The whole structural-watch apparatus — 3-way baseline,
  conflict prompt (`[m]/[l]/[r]`), `workflow.remote.json`, promptFactory
  injection — is deleted.
- **Browser live-reload proxy (plans/5) is removed (Plan 52).** n8n 2.x
  reflects an MCP `update_workflow` draft edit in the open editor **natively**
  (soft canvas re-render via `collaborationService.broadcastWorkflowUpdate` →
  a `workflowUpdated` push, skipped — with a warning — when the tab has
  unsaved edits), making decanter's injected reload proxy redundant and, on
  its dirty-tab path, strictly worse (a hard `location.reload()` would
  destroy those edits). `watch` now just prints the editor deep link and a
  "keep it open" note; `lib/proxy.mts`/`test/proxy.mts` are gone, along with
  the `browserReload`/`proxyPort` config keys. The write-lock failure mode
  this surfaces (n8n's single-writer `LockedError` when a human is mid-edit)
  is tracked separately, plans/draft/53.

## MCP guard (`mcp connect` stdio + `mcp serve` HTTP, plans/33 + retirement wave)

Technical enforcement of the Code-node boundary the template's `AGENTS.md`
states in prose — one guard core (`guardMessage` in `lib/mcpserve.mts`), two
transports:

- **`mcp connect` (`lib/mcpconnect.mts`) is the default route** — a stdio MCP
  server the agent spawns itself, which is what lets `init` scaffold a
  static, secret-free `.mcp.json`/`opencode.json` entry
  (`{"command":"n8n-decanter","args":["mcp","connect"]}`): the instance MCP
  is wired the moment init runs. One JSON-RPC message per line; stdout is
  protocol-only (stderr logging; the dispatcher builds a stderr `Log` and a
  stderr-logging `McpClient`); strictly ordered processing (session-id
  capture race-free); SSE responses decoded back to per-line JSON; n8n's
  202-empty for notifications emits nothing; upstream-down answers an
  in-band JSON-RPC error naming the host; parse failures fail closed
  (-32700); same 401-refresh-once and bounded 429/Retry-After policy as the
  MCP client. No secret exists — stdio pipes are private to the two
  processes.
- **`mcp serve` is the HTTP variant** for harnesses that only take an MCP
  URL. Decanter is the sole credential holder: the proxy authenticates
  agents with a per-session random secret (printed once; also written with
  the endpoint to a gitignored `.decanter-proxy.json` for tooling discovery)
  and forwards upstream with the real bearer/OAuth token via
  `McpClient.bearerToken()` — inheriting the refresh-race coordination; one
  forced refresh on an upstream 401.
- **Requests are parsed, responses pipe through untouched** (SSE included).
  The block rule: `tools/call` → `update_workflow` that writes Code-node
  source → answered in-band with an instructive `isError` tool result
  ("edit the file + push"). Both write routes n8n's `update_workflow` op
  vocabulary exposes are covered: a `jsCode` **key** at any depth
  (`updateNodeParameters`/`addNode`), and a `setNodeParameter` whose
  JSON-Pointer `path` targets `jsCode` (code in a scalar `value`, no key —
  the bypass the branch review caught). The rest of the op vocabulary is
  deliberately NOT enumerated; only these two source-writing routes are
  intercepted. Unparseable bodies **fail closed** (403), bodies over 10 MB get
  413 (drain-then-respond — destroying the socket would RST before the
  client reads the answer), non-secret requests 401 without touching n8n.
- Binds `127.0.0.1` only; default port 5680 (`--port`, `0` = ephemeral).
  Blast radius is availability, not integrity: decanter's own sync never
  routes through the proxy.
- **Live snapshot mirror (Plan 51 Part A, `lib/mirror.mts`).** Both transports
  share one orchestrator: after forwarding a **non-blocked** `update_workflow`
  (a structure edit), the guard calls `mirror.schedule(arguments.workflowId)`,
  which debounced-background-`pull`s that workflow so `workflow.json` refreshes
  with no manual `pull` (`mirrorTargetId` in `mcpserve.mts` extracts the id;
  the same client the guard forwards with does the pull). Rails: fire-and-
  forget (scheduled *after* the response relays — never blocks the agent);
  git-required + safety-commit-before-pull; per-workflow debounce + overlap
  guard (an injected clock makes it unit-testable); tracked-only. On by
  default; `liveMirror: false` disables it. The orchestrator is a pure
  scheduler over an injected `refresh`/clock/git-probe, so the debounce/overlap
  logic is tested without ports or a real pull.
- Template stack: `mcp-route-check.mjs` (SessionStart hook, shared script —
  config-drift detector, not an op inspector) warns when an agent MCP config
  in the sync dir reaches an n8n `/mcp-server/http` endpoint that isn't
  loopback; `AGENTS.md.example` states the boundary proxy-first.

## Scenarios — committed pin-data sets (`scenario`, plans/7 + 37)

`lib/simulate.mts` (scenario read/write) + `lib/executions.mts` (dir consts,
migration) — a **scenario** (`workflows/<folder>/scenarios/<slug>.json`) is a
named, committed input set for a workflow — captured from a real run or
scaffolded from its schemas — replayed and diffed by both
`simulate --scenario <slug>` and `test --scenario <slug>`. It's the **one
committed pin artifact** (Plan 37 folded the earlier `mock`/`fixtures` split
into it):

- **Self-contained, no precedence.** A scenario is execution-shaped
  (verbatim capture + a `_decanterScenario` metadata block) — every
  pinnable node's data lives in one file; there is no fixture-over-capture
  layering to reason about (the earlier per-node `fixtures/` mechanism and
  `simulate --pin` are removed outright). Chosen explicitly by slug, never a
  "latest" default.
- **Two composable seeds.** `scenario create --execution <id>` promotes a
  gitignored capture, recording each node with captured output as
  provenance `capture` and listing every remaining gap under
  `_decanterScenario.fill`. `scenario create --scaffold` calls MCP
  `prepare_test_pin_data` (read-only) and annotates each gap with its
  output **JSON Schema** (`expectedSchema`), provenance `scaffolded` — the
  tool returns schemas + coverage counts only, **no data**
  (`readOnlyHint: true`; this corrects an earlier misread of the tool that
  assumed server-generated synthetic data). A bare `--scaffold` with no
  `--execution` builds a from-scratch set where every pinnable node is a
  fill entry. Neither seed **invents** a value — filling stays a person's
  or agent's authoring step, reviewed like any other scenario edit.
- **Per-node provenance drives the report.** Each node's pins are
  `capture` (real data — usable as a diff baseline), `authored`
  (hand/agent-filled, no schema), or `scaffolded` (schema-guided). A run on
  a scenario with **any** non-`capture` node is reported "synthetic pins —
  proves executability, not output correctness": no per-node diff is
  asserted for it, and divergence is informational, not a fail. A
  capture-only scenario keeps the full per-node diff and
  exit-1-on-divergence semantics unchanged. `--json` reports
  (`simulate`/`test`) carry `syntheticPins: boolean` and
  `provenance: Record<node, "capture" | "authored" | "scaffolded">`.
- **Migration.** A pre-Plan-37 `mocks/` dir auto-migrates to `scenarios/`
  the first time any verb (`simulate`/`test`/`scenario`) touches it (plain
  `renameSync`, git-recorded); refuses when both dirs exist. A leftover
  `fixtures/` dir is a **hard error** naming the replacement — no read
  path, no silent fold (per-node fragments merging onto a gitignored
  capture would commit data nobody reviewed). The legacy metadata key
  `_decanterMock` is still read (as `_decanterScenario`) for scenarios
  written before the rename.
- **`scenario check`** validates one scenario or every scenario in the
  folder, offline, against the exact runData shape `simulate` consumes
  (n8n publishes no JSON Schema for execution data); `simulate --scenario`/
  `test --scenario` run the same check on load.
- **Relation to the official skills.** `n8n-workflow-lifecycle-official`
  teaches the same `prepare_test_pin_data` tool for an **ephemeral**
  in-session flow (schemas → agent-generated values → `test_workflow`,
  per-execution, unpersisted). Scenarios are the durable counterpart:
  committed, human-reviewed, reused across runs, and diffed against real
  data when capture-seeded.

## Backups — git-native disaster recovery (`backup`, plans/51 Part B)

`lib/backup.mts` (+ `lib/api.mts` `getWorkflow`/`createWorkflow`) — a
**versioned, redeployable** DR store per workflow
(`workflows/<slug>/backups/<ts>.<versionId>.json`), REST-sourced because MCP's
read is sanitized (the spike verdicts are recorded in the design-decisions
section above). It is disaster recovery, **not** sync: `restore` creates a
*new* workflow, never reconciling an existing one — structure ownership stays
with n8n.

- **`backup create`** REST-GETs the draft tip, **dedups** on an unchanged
  `versionId` (no redundant identical copies), strips `pinData`/`staticData`,
  keeps credential refs + `description`, and replaces each **tracked** Code
  node's `jsCode` with its `//@file:` placeholder (no code duplication; an
  untracked Code node keeps inline code + a "pull first" warn). Writes the new
  timestamped file, then **rolling-prunes** the working set to `backupLimit`
  (default 20; `0` = keep all — git holds the full history regardless).
  **Not auto-committed** and **not self-gitignored** — the file carries
  credential refs + any embedded secrets, so the user reviews + `git add`s
  deliberately; committing it is the whole point.
- **`backup restore`** selects a backup (latest default; `--version-id <id>` /
  `--at <ts>` / a TTY chooser — the selector is *not* spelled `--version`, which
  is reserved CLI-wide for printing the installed version), compliance-guards the folder, re-inlines each
  placeholdered Code node's source from `code/` (reusing `buildNodeCode`/
  `placeholderFile` from push — `.ts` compiled), and REST-POSTs an **allowlist
  body** (`name`/`nodes`/`connections`/`settings`) → a **new** workflow, node
  ids preserved, landing **unpublished**. Prints credential-rebind hints (refs
  point at the source instance) + the editor URL; publish is the operator's
  next step.
- **`backup list`** (offline) prints the retained set: timestamp · versionId ·
  node count.
- **Auth:** REST-only → `requireApiKey` gates `create`/`restore` (`list` is
  offline). The `backup` namespace mirrors the `node`/`scenario`/`mcp`
  sub-verb dispatch in `n8n-decanter.mts`.

## Instance-side test runs (`test`, plans/33)

`lib/testrun.mts` — the recommended runtime check, wrapping MCP
`test_workflow` (synchronous; the server caps the run at 5 minutes, so the
verb uses a dedicated client with a ≥320 s timeout):

- **Pin split = `simulate`'s classification** (shared code): every enabled
  non-pure, non-loop-driver node — trigger/network/credentialed — is pinned
  from the capture (`--execution`, default newest) or a committed scenario
  (`--scenario`, see above); a node with no pinned data is a hard **gap**
  error before anything runs (an unpinned network node would hit the real
  world). Pure nodes execute for real on the instance; `--trigger` →
  `triggerNodeName`. Provenance/synthetic-pins labeling is shared with
  `simulate` (above).
- **Always the draft tip.** Pre-check read captures `versionId` +
  per-node byte-exact jsCode. Local ≠ draft on a TTY → the what-to-test
  prompt (local = drift-guarded draft-only push first; draft wording:
  live-workflow vs current-draft); unpublished skips the prompt and pushes.
  After a pushed test: keep, or restore via `restore_workflow_version`
  (n8n ≥ 2.29) with a write-back fallback gated on the draft still matching
  our push; the pre-push snapshot persists crash-safe in
  `executions/.test-snapshot.json` (the test verb writes the `executions/*`
  self-ignore first, so the snapshot's inline jsCode can never be committed
  by the push auto-commit even in a repo without the root-level ignore);
  state re-baselines after restore so
  local edits read "pending push", not conflict. **Non-TTY never mutates**
  and prints "tested the draft, not your local code" when local differs —
  no choice flags, choices are verb composition.
- **Diff** (client-side): the test execution is read back over MCP
  `get_execution(includeData)`; each pure node with captured expectations
  diffs first-run/first-output items via `simulate`'s `diffItems`; exit 1
  on divergence; `--json` emits the report. The verb takes exactly ONE
  workflow ref (the plan sketched `[workflow…]`; selectors are per-workflow,
  so multi-ref was dropped for `simulate` parity).
- `simulate` stays the offline sibling (decided 2026-07-22): pre-push
  verification of uncommitted code, CI without an instance, isolation,
  version rehearsal — docs recommend `test` first everywhere.

## Preflight — the scored verification gate (`preflight`, plans/36)

`lib/preflight.mts` orchestrates the whole ladder into one read-only, scored
verdict. It adds **zero execution paths** — it reuses `check`/`status`/`test`/
`simulate`/`executions` quietly (a silent `Log`) and scores their returned
facts. Nothing it does mutates (no push/publish/restore/draft write).

- **Ladder (stable check ids agents key on), fast → slow:** static `layout`
  (`validateWorkflowDir`), `types` (`runTypecheckResult`); sync `connect` +
  `access` (one `getWorkflowDetails` — a reach-and-auth success is `connect`
  pass, an `isUnavailableInMcp` refusal is `connect` pass + `access` fail, any
  other error is `connect` fail), `parity`/`drift`/`snapshot` (from
  `computeSyncFacts` — a per-node code-sync core **extracted from**
  `statusWorkflow`, which is now a thin renderer over it so `status` stays
  byte-identical), `lifecycle` (`publicationState`/`publishedVersionLagsDraft`),
  `history` (production-run health), `capture` (a pin source exists + matches
  the draft); runtime `test` (`runTest` in a new **`neverMutate`** mode) and
  `simulate` (`runSimulation` headless, `networkNone` forced).
- **Profiles** (deterministic, no auto-escalation): `--quick` = static+sync,
  default = +`test`, `--full` = +`simulate`, `--offline` = static+`simulate`
  (no instance — joins the dispatcher's `offline` set so `loadConfig` skips
  `requireHost`). A check outside the active profile is a `skip` with an unlock.
- **Scoring/verdict/coverage are pure functions** (unit-tested without IO):
  score starts at 100, each `fail` −40 (a `CONFLICT` `drift` −30), each `warn`
  −10, floor 0. Verdict: any `fail` → `not ready` (exit 1); else any `warn` →
  `caution` (exit 0, `--fail-on=warn` → 1); else `ready`. `--require=<ids>`
  promotes a skip of a named check to a `fail` at emit time (so the streamed
  line, the summary, and `--fail-fast` all agree). `--json` emits the report
  (single object, or an array for a multi-ref run); `--fail-fast` stops after
  the first failure.
- **Executions in the gate:** before the runtime tier, a `capture`-source run
  with no explicit `--execution` auto-fetches the newest capture when
  `N8N_API_KEY` is set and the local one is missing/stale (`--no-fetch` opts
  out; read-only, gitignored). `history` reads recent production runs via a new
  MCP `searchExecutions` wrapper (`search_executions` — shape source-verified
  and smoke-asserted on 2.30.7: `{data:[{id,workflowId,status,mode,startedAt,
  stoppedAt}],count,estimated}`) with a REST `listExecutions({includeData:
  false})` fallback (a new lightweight variant — the old one always pulled full
  run data); a live workflow that's been failing is a `warn`, never a `fail`.
- **Seams added (all behavior-preserving):** `runTypecheckResult` (fact core
  under `runTypecheck`), `computeSyncFacts` (fact core under `statusWorkflow`),
  `runTest({neverMutate})`, `api.listExecutions({includeData})`,
  `mcp.searchExecutions`. Multi-ref like `pull`/`push`/`status` (no-ref TTY →
  picker; piped → config workflows; aggregate exit).

## Init flow (`n8n-decanter init [dir]`)

Bootstraps a sync directory. Plan 32 made it OAuth-first:

1. **Host** prompt (existing `.env` value reused with a note; normalized).
2. **MCP credentials** — existing `N8N_MCP_TOKEN` or a host-matching
   `.decanter-auth.json` are reused. Otherwise, on a TTY: the **OAuth
   consent flow** (`runOAuthConsent` in `lib/mcp.mts`) — RFC 7591 dynamic
   client registration → PKCE S256 authorize URL opened in the browser
   (`DECANTER_NO_BROWSER=1` prints it only) → localhost callback server
   catches the code → token exchange → `.decanter-auth.json` (0600). Any
   failure falls back to a paste-a-token prompt. Piped/non-TTY runs skip the
   browser and go straight to the token prompt — init stays scriptable
   (`printf "host\ntoken\nkey\n" | n8n-decanter init`).
3. **Optional API key** prompt (Enter to skip) — executions / data-tables /
   backup only (Plan 33 + 51).
4. `.env` is rewritten preserving unknown keys (comments are not preserved);
   template copy (modification-aware manifest machinery, unchanged — see
   below), `decanter.config.json` scaffold, `.gitignore` (now also covering
   `.decanter-auth.json`).
5. **Verification probes**: an MCP `search_workflows` reporting how many
   workflows are visible and how many are `availableInMCP` (with a hint about
   the per-workflow switch), plus the old `GET /api/v1/workflows?limit=1`
   probe when an API key was given.
6. **The official-skills pointer** (Plan 55, `lib/skills.mts`) — dead last, so
   it can never block credential setup. On a **first** init (no
   `.decanter-template.json` yet) decanter names the pack and prints the
   **shell** install commands for all three routes (Claude Code / Codex /
   skills.sh), detected agent first, each with its activation step. Detection
   reads env / `PATH` / home markers and **spawns nothing**.

   It is **output only, on every path, consuming no input** — deliberately not
   a prompt and not a subprocess. A prompt would add a fourth positional answer
   to init's stdin and break every existing script; a subprocess would mean
   decanter driving three third-party CLIs with their own version floors to
   mutate user-global agent state, at the most fragile moment of setup, for a
   plugin that isn't active until the agent reloads anyway. No flag tunes it:
   once per sync dir is cheap enough that a CLI surface isn't warranted.

   Claude Code's `<claude-code-hint/>` stderr protocol would be the natural fit
   but is silently dropped for non-Anthropic marketplaces, so it isn't used.
   Actually *installing* — declaratively, via `.claude/settings.json`
   (`extraKnownMarketplaces` + `enabledPlugins`) — is Plan 56.

**One shared prompt session** serves every question — a second
`createPrompt()` would lose piped answers the first one buffered (the same
class of bug the buffering prompt helper solved in the API era; rediscovered
when init grew multiple questions).

The template machinery (dpkg-conffile-style `.decanter-template.json`
manifest, `X.example` materialization, `--force` semantics) is unchanged from
plans/16. The template's agent contract (`AGENTS.md.example`) was rewritten
for Plan 32: Code-node source is authored as files and synced by decanter —
never edited on the instance (UI, MCP tools, or skills); `workflow.json` is a
read-only snapshot; structure/lifecycle may go through n8n's MCP tools and
the official n8n skills pack, whose **knowledge** skills are recommended
while the build/lifecycle skills are subordinated to the decanter override
(Task 9 — the override, not selective installation, holds the boundary; the
pack installs whole). Plan 55 added the install instructions there in both
forms (in-session slash commands *and* the shell CLI — they are not
interchangeable) plus the `using-n8n-skills-official` routing cue the
plugin-less skills.sh route needs, since that route ships no SessionStart hook.

## Type checking

Unchanged by Plan 32 (the file layer is decanter's layer):

- `tsconfig.json`: `allowJs` + `checkJs`, includes `workflows/`, excludes
  `**/*.remote.js` (harmless legacy exclusion); `moduleDetection: "force"`.
- `scripts/typecheck.mts` wraps node files in an in-memory `async function`
  (node files recognized by a `.decanter.json` sibling — directly or in the
  parent of their `code/` dir) and maps diagnostic lines back; files on disk
  stay verbatim. `decanter-ts-plugin/` suppresses TS1108/TS1375/TS1378 on
  node files in editors (plans/4).
- `npm run typecheck` = `tsc -p tsconfig.cli.json` (the CLI's own strict
  sources) + the wrapper script.

### The emulated-globals surface (Plan 43)

`n8n-globals.d.ts` is decanter's **own** hand-written, MIT-clean subset of n8n's
Code-node globals (n8n's authoritative surface — `WorkflowDataProxy` +
`getAdditionalKeys` — is Sustainable-Use-Licensed, so its text is never
vendored). It is **single-sourced**: `init` copies the one root file into a sync
dir (no `template/*.example` duplicate to drift).

`node run` is the **offline approximation** rung of the verification ladder, not
a faithful n8n context — `test` (real draft over MCP) is the fidelity backstop.
Its `buildGlobals` ([lib/run.mts](lib/run.mts)) classifies each declared global as
one of three, and a parity test keeps *declared* (the `.d.ts`) and *emulated*
(`buildGlobals`) in lock-step — every global is exactly one of:

- **Emulated** — pure/offline meaning: `$jmespath`/`$jmesPath` (n8n's pinned
  `jmespath@0.16.0` `search(data, expr)`), `$items`/`$node` views over the
  fixture, Luxon `DateTime`/`Duration`/`Interval`, `$nodeId`/`$nodeVersion` from
  the node entry.
- **Pinnable** from the fixture: `$input`/`$json`/`$env`/`$vars`/`$secrets`/
  `$workflow`/`$execution`/`$getWorkflowStaticData`/…
- **Signposted** — genuinely instance-scoped, so `run` refuses it with one
  friendly *"not emulated in `run` — use `test`, or pin it in the fixture"*
  message (never a bare `ReferenceError`): `$vars`/`$secrets` when unpinned,
  `$evaluateExpression` (needs the expression engine).

Expression-language extensions (`$if`/`$min`/`$max`/`$ifEmpty`) are deliberately
**not** declared — they resolve inside `{{ }}` expressions, not the Code node's
JS, so they throw in real n8n too. `scripts/globals-drift-audit.mts` reads n8n's
proxy at a pinned tag to flag newly-added globals (names only, license-clean).

## Milestones

1. ✅ Scaffold + pull, single workflow (API era — validated the data model).
2. ✅ push — reassembly, compile+marker, drift guard (API era).
3. ✅ multi-workflow loop + rename handling by id.
4. ⬜ n8n folder hierarchy — rescoped 2026-07-22 to **read-only "Local
   Overview"** (pull mirrors n8n placement as local dir nesting; decanter
   never writes folders/placement); blocked on one upstream MCP read fix
   ([Plan 8](plans/blocked/8-folder-hierarchy-in-sync-layout.md)).
5. ✅ QoL: `watch`, `status`.
6. ✅ `init`; 7. ✅ compliance guard + `check`; 8. ✅ structural validation +
   `rename` (plans/2).
9. ✅ **Plan 32 (2026-07-22): MCP-native code layer** — `lib/mcp.mts` client
   + OAuth, pull/push/status/watch re-based (draft-first, code-only),
   structure verbs forwarded, lifecycle re-based, picker third state, init
   OAuth-first, template contract rewritten, e2e mock became a REST+MCP mock,
   smoke suite drives the MCP path on the real container (28 steps green on
   2.30.7).

## Implementation notes (decisions & observations)

Validated by `npm test` (unit + e2e with an in-process **REST+MCP mock** +
interactive suites) and the opt-in Docker smoke suite. Notes from the
API-era build that still hold are kept; superseded ones are marked.

- **Top-level `return`**: node code is a function body; esbuild accepts it,
  `tsc` rejects it (TS1108) → the typecheck wrapper.
- **`lastPushedHash` means "remote code hash at last sync"** (push *or*
  pull). Pull re-baselines even when surfacing an edit/conflict — otherwise
  push would stay blocked forever after a warned pull. Consequence: after a
  warned pull, push overwrites the surfaced remote edits; `status --diff` +
  git history are the safety net.
- **Hashes are recorded from a post-write confirming read** (Plan 32) — MCP
  `update_workflow` returns a summary, never the workflow; the confirming
  `get_workflow_details` is the successor of the API-era "record from the
  PUT response" rule and doubles as the byte-exact round-trip check.
- **Name↔id reconciliation is a lookup, not machinery** (Plan 32 Task 3):
  MCP addresses nodes by name, state is keyed by id, and push resolves
  id → current name from the fresh read it needs anyway. Renames from any
  actor are absorbed for free; ids surviving renames is the load-bearing
  server behavior (spike-verified).
- **n8n rate-limits the MCP endpoint (429)** — discovered live when the smoke
  suite's rapid CLI runs tripped it; the client's backoff-retry (safe: a
  429'd request was not applied) fixed it. Also: each CLI process does the
  full initialize handshake — acceptable, but part of why bursts hit limits.
- **OAuth refresh tokens are single-use** (rotate-on-refresh,
  `invalid_grant` on reuse — verified live). The client persists the rotated
  pair immediately and caches access tokens to keep refreshes rare;
  concurrent processes racing a refresh is accepted (the loser gets the
  "re-run init" error).
- **Extension transitions are never auto-renamed**: a local `.ts` is never
  clobbered by an unmarked remote, and compiled output is never relabeled as
  TS source — warn-only since Plan 32 (no `.remote.js` artifacts).
- **Filename sanitization / kebab-case `code/` layout**: unchanged
  (plans/2 + backlog decisions — `/ \ : * ? " < > |` → `-`, collisions get
  `-<id8>`, per-pull deterministic).
- **`run` staticData + `$env` isolation** (plans/3 A, 2026-07-20): unchanged.
- **Name resolution is composed, not monolithic** (plans/11): unchanged;
  `pull`'s remote fallback now queries `search_workflows`.
- **Nodes deleted remotely** are dropped from state with a warning; files
  stay on disk (git is the safety net). On push they warn + skip.
- **Watch internals**: dir watches (editor saves replace inodes), 200 ms
  debounce, dirty-set, state re-read per event — unchanged; the structural
  half is gone (see Watch mode).
- **Browser live-reload proxy** (plans/5): removed (Plan 52) — n8n's own
  editor reflects MCP draft edits live, dirty-safe; see Watch mode above.
- **Piped stdin for prompts**: `readline/promises` drops early lines and
  hangs on EOF → the buffering prompt helper; **one session per command** —
  a second `createPrompt()` loses lines the first one buffered (Plan 32
  rediscovery when init grew multiple questions).
- **TypeScript CLI + publish-build pipeline** (plans/6, plans/13): unchanged
  — native type stripping in dev, compiled `dist/` in the npm tarball,
  `erasableSyntaxOnly`, extension-aware runtime spots.
- **Testing**: the e2e suite is one sequential, stateful scenario against a
  single shared mock that now serves **both** surfaces — `POST
  /mcp-server/http` (bearer-authed JSON-RPC; initialize answers plain JSON,
  tools/call answers SSE so both client parser branches stay covered; ops
  applied with the verified merge/rename/re-mint semantics; per-workflow
  `availableInMCP` honored) and the REST endpoints for the API-only verbs.
  Async exec stays mandatory (in-process mock). `McpClient` has its own unit
  suite (envelope/SSE parsing, auth precedence, refresh rotation persistence,
  401/404/timeout mapping) against a scripted `node:http` server; push's
  drift/addressing logic is unit-tested through `pushWorkflow` with a stub
  `callTool`. The smoke suite bootstraps MCP itself (enable + rotate token +
  per-workflow toggle via the owner cookie — spike-only internals, fine for a
  throwaway container) and exercises the gate, draft-first pushes,
  `--force`, the MCP rename (id stability + server-side reference rewriting,
  live), watch, and lifecycle on the real image.
- **`shared/` bundling in `.ts` nodes** (plans/14): unchanged, including the
  export-free entry and CJS-interop rewrite (n8n's task-runner sandbox
  neuters getter descriptors) and the "no-import nodes keep byte-identical
  plain output" guarantee.
- **n8n 2.x publish semantics — API era, superseded but explanatory
  (researched 2026-07-18):** the public API's `PUT` hardcoded
  `publishIfActive: true` and `forceSave: true` (no reachable optimistic
  locking), which is why the API-era decanter had auto-publish-on-push and a
  PUT-canonical drift guard. Plan 32's MCP path made both obsolete: writes
  are draft-only by construction and the per-node hash check is the conflict
  protection. The version-aware `status` fields (`versionId` /
  `activeVersionId`, `publishedVersionLagsDraft`) carried over unchanged —
  they're first-class in the MCP responses too.

## Open questions (verify against a live instance)

- ~~Folder placement on the API GET~~ — answered no (2026-07-19/20, Plan 8
  blocked on upstream exposure). ~~MCP note: `get_workflow_details` carries a
  `parentFolderId` field (null in tests) — re-check Plan 8 against the MCP
  surface when it matters.~~ Re-checked 2026-07-22 from n8n source (master +
  2.30.7): the field is in the output contract but the handler never loads the
  `parentFolder` relation (`includeParentFolder` defaults false at the call
  site), so it is **always null** — an upstream one-line wiring gap, not a
  design stance. The folder *tree* is readable (`search_folders`), but MCP has
  no move op and no folder create; only `create_workflow_from_code` takes a
  `folderId`. Plan 8 stays blocked (and was rescoped 2026-07-22 to read-only
  local mirroring — "Local Overview"); full findings in its "MCP re-check"
  section.
- ~~Filename sanitization; PUT round-trip preservation of tags/pinData;
  activate/deactivate shapes; create body; DELETE on published~~ — all
  answered in the API era (see git history of this file); the still-relevant
  outcomes are recorded above.
- **MCP surface churn**: the tool inventory grew between spike and docs
  (33 → 40+ tools; execution reads, version-history tools appeared). The
  Plan 32 client pins only the six tools listed under "MCP backend"; anything
  new (e.g. re-basing `executions`, version-history reads) is future-plan
  material, re-verified against a live instance first.
- **Refresh-token concurrency**: two decanter processes refreshing the same
  OAuth session race the rotation (loser needs re-consent). Accepted for
  now — access-token caching makes it rare; revisit if it bites (keychain
  storage / lockfile are candidates).
